### Howdy folks! 👋
### I'm Precious Omonzejele, the CodeXplorer 🤾🏽‍♂️🥞🦜🤡 (Original)

### Current Battle 🦸🏽‍♂️
🔭 I’m currently working on my **[open source plugin for WordPress and WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-phone-validator)** 


### - 📫 How to reach me(For Contact)
Yup, my website is still not fully ready.
 - "Why won't you have a website being a Developer?"

    First of all, I am a **CodeXplorer(just a fancy Programmer name to be different 🌝, I can write codes well too)**, There's a saying that _"Not all Mechanics(automobile engineers) own a car"_, I don't know if that's valid in your country, but in my country, it's very true 💯.
